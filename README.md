# Binary-Segmentation

An user interactive semi-automatic binary segmentation model implemented in OpenCV 3.3.0 and Python 2.7. Given sparse markings of foreground and background by the user, it calculates SLIC superpixels, and runs a graph-cut algorithm. Color histograms are calculated for all superpixels and foreground background. This algorithm takes into account superpixel-superpixel and superpixel-Foreground/Background interaction to obtain a final binary image segmentation.
